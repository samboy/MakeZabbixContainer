# MakeZabbixContainer

For an assignment I did for a possible position, I have made a shell script
that makes a Docker container running Zazzle (no, I am not making a 
Dockerfile because this script, in theory, can more easily be ported
to other virtualization platforms).

Considering how long it took to make this script (far too long for an
interview-related question), I am making this script available under 
an open source license.
